<b>I am not responsible and will take no responsibility for any consequences incurred by creating a malicious USB, using it on an unauthorised device/system and the aftermath of such an action.

It is important that the user understands the gravity of the consequences of deploying a malicious BadUSB.</b>

This github repository is for my Introduction to Secuity project, which is 'Making your own malicious USB'.

This project looks at how we can create a BadUSB using a Digispark ATTiny85 USB development board. All the user needs to get started is Arduino, with the relevant digispark board manager and drivers installed and a Digispark ATTiny85.
